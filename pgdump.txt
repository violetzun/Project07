17	The Hunger Games: Catching Fire	<p>\r\n\t I actually was not going to write a review but after reading all those "best movie ever" comments, I felt the responsibility to write something. I watched the movie at an IMax (where even the worst movie looks OK) but there was nothing visually spectacular. Character development phase is not that bad but there was no character that I could like (including Katniss. Actually especially Katniss). There was nothing special about the performance of Jennifer Lawrence to say the least. She really needs to work on acting and expressions. She was really boring. The other characters don't even have an impact. When it comes to the story, it is somewhat not so believable. I am a huge fan of sci-fi and fantastic movies but the story of Hunger Games has never been appealing to me. Anyway, do not trust that super positive reviews. This is an average movie with an average story and average acting.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img style="width: 408px;" src="/system/redactor_assets/pictures/5/the-hunger-games-catching-fire-comic-con-trailer.jpg">\r\n</p>	1	2013-12-08 17:22:39.830794	2013-12-08 17:26:08.008605	0	1

20	The Hunger Games: Catching Fire	<h2>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</h2>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img src="http://static.rogerebert.com/uploads/review/primary_image/reviews/the-hunger-games-catching-fire-2013/hero_HungerGamesCatchingFire-2013-1.jpg">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen a movie like "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" comes along, it  makes my inner feminist-leaning 13-year-old stand up and cheer. Of  course, the mere existence of a successful girl-powered franchise that  does not revolve around potential suitors with supernatural powers is  enough to keep her smiling.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe scene in "Catching Fire" that especially fired up my lingering adolescent alter-ego? When <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jennifer-lawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a>—essential as warrior heroine Katniss Everdeen in Round 2 of this young-adult lit-based enterprise, much in the same way that <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/vivien-leigh">Vivien Leigh</a> was indispensable in "<a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-gone-with-the-wind-1939">Gone With the Wind</a>"—suddenly  twirls about in her would-be wedding dress during a TV interview meant  to distract the downtrodden populace of Panem. What initially looks like  a multi-tiered, white-frosted cage is engulfed in flames and transforms  into a supple midnight-bluish winged symbol of subversion that emulates  the Mockingjay, the mascot of a growing rebellion in the land. One gown  represents female entrapment and expectations, the other human freedom  and opportunity. Call it a Barbie-meets-Joan of Arc moment. And not  every man can rock a lavender ponytail and a pompadour at the same time,  but darn if <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/stanley-tucci">Stanley Tucci</a>’s  fawning oil-slick of a TV host Caesar Flickerman—part Ryan Seacrest,  part Siegfried and Roy—manages to pull it off. "Girl on Fire is so  cheeky," he declares of Katniss with a half-smile, half-sneer when she  performs her dress trick.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes, fashion can be a weapon for good  and a vehicle for revolution—at least in this dystopia, with its Fascist  regime led by the serenely insidious President Snow (<a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/donald-sutherland">Donald Sutherland</a>). Here, gawd-awful gaudy too often passes for style. We are talking about you, <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/elizabeth-banks">Elizabeth Banks</a>,  in the guise of giddy government-instated cheerleader Effie Trinket,  with bedazzled Oompa Loompa wigs and eyelashes that appear to be leaden  lace cookies. (At least she is allowed to be a warmer presence this time  around.)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKatniss’s quick-change act is almost topped by the sight  of Lawrence going full-on Liz Taylor in "Cleopatra" with Roman-circus  hair and makeup, riding in a chariot before a thunderous throng and  later wearing another stunning bird-inspired outfit to a pre-Hunger  Games soiree. Good thing that the flinty-eyed Oscar winner is as adept  at silently conveying the haunted psyche of her ace archer as she is at  showcasing these fantasy frocks. Otherwise, it would be even more  obvious that—just like any other No. 2 in an ongoing franchise—"Catching  Fire" is merely a placeholder. And it is particularly dour experience  given Katniss’s post-traumatic state of mind, as the plot simply picks  up where the first movie left off and closes nowhere near to a  satisfying climax.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe 2 ½-hour running time is split in two:  First, we learn that Katniss’s ploy last time to upend the rules of the  games so that she and faux boyfriend Peeta Mellark (<a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/josh-hutcherson">Josh Hutcherson</a>,  still unduly cuddly) would both survive as co-champions has made  Penam’s less fortunate think they, too, can rise against their  overlords. As the supposed engaged couple go on tour to greet their  fans, it becomes clear they see Katniss as an inspirational leader, a  role she inch-by-inch grows to accept.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWith an assist from <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/philip-seymour-hoffman">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>  as the too-smooth-to-be-true new gamesmaker Plutarch Heavensbee, Snow  announces a special all-stars edition of the 75th-anniversary Hunger  Games Quarter Quell. Former victors of previous games recruited from  Panem’s 12 districts will be pitted against one another, and Katniss and  Peeta must put their lives on the line again.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe last hour is  devoted to an Olympian death match in a mock tropical jungle. The fun,  such as it is, begins with such visually intriguing challenges as toxic  mist, rabid baboons and a downpour of blood. Several welcome new battle  participants come aboard. Much like Hoffman, such terrific talents as <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jeffrey-wright">Jeffrey Wright</a>, <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/amanda-plummer">Amanda Plummer</a> and <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jena-malone">Jena Malone</a>  are overqualified for their parts, but each delivers a distinctly  defined character that brightens the proceedings considerably. At least  Malone as the punk-cool Johanna provides Lawrence with a fierce foil to  play against. The biggest and maybe only true laugh arrives when Johanna  strips off her clothes in an elevator to the appreciation of Peeta and  the disdain of Katniss.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDirector <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/francis-lawrence">Francis Lawrence</a> ("<a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/i-am-legend-2007">I Am Legend</a>," "<a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/water-for-elephants-2011">Water for Elephants</a>") is confident enough to not go too heavy on the much-disdained hand-held camerawork used by his predecessor, <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/gary-ross">Gary Ross</a>. With a script by two Oscar-winning writers, "<a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/slumdog-millionaire-2008">Slumdog Millionaire</a>"’s <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/simon-beaufoy">Simon Beaufoy</a> and "<a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/little-miss-sunshine-2006">Little Miss Sunshine</a>"’s <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/michael-arndt">Michael Arndt</a> (although credited as Michael deBruyn), the action and even the speechifying move along swiftly enough.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t  Yet "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" suffers from the same “something  old, something borrowed “ disease that is the enemy of originality in  too many Hollywood efforts of late. It is difficult to enjoy a film when  you are checking off all the sources it references—"Lost" and  "Survivor" from television, Star Wars (what is with the Stormtrooper  ripoffs?) and "<a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-running-man-1987">The Running Man</a>" from movies, and Roman and Greek myths.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat  makes the books and the films compelling is the way they define  anxieties and pop-culture obsessions in our everyday lives: anger over  politicians, fascination with celebrities, a growing disgruntled  underclass, addiction to reality shows and video games, the regularity  of large-scale violent acts that monopolize TV coverage, and hateful  outbreaks of bullying.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course, the one truly fresh  invention—and the one that matters most—is Katniss herself. With each  on-screen chapter, the poor girl from District 12 continues to fulfill  her destiny as an inspiration and a rebel fighter. She is but one  female, but she's the perfect antidote to the surplus of male  superheroes out there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd talk about a brewing rebellion: this  is the rare action blockbuster that dares to make do without 3D. We who  wear glasses already and would rather spend the ticket premium on  popcorn salute you, Katniss and company .\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTT___TT\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img src="/system/redactor_assets/pictures/9/hunger-games-444173.jpg">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img src="http://www.google.co.th/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;docid=Ibq26jJd8utW5M&amp;tbnid=8L-bZFIeARI51M:&amp;ved=0CAUQjRw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.express.co.uk%2Fentertainment%2Ffilms%2F444173%2FThe-Hunger-Games-Catching-Fire-review-and-trailer&amp;ei=7rWkUsK_Fc-WiQfdooGYDw&amp;bvm=bv.57752919,d.dGI&amp;psig=AFQjCNEr_VA12LQyn0pqyaTAHR59J5iB9Q&amp;ust=1386612567861557">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Oscar winning actress talks red carpet looks and maintaining a private life in Hollywood.\r\n</p>\r\n<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/wNydJOSbhm4" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560">\r\n</iframe>	7	2013-12-08 17:58:00.47809	2013-12-08 18:11:54.928894	0	1

Winning means that they must turn around and leave their family and close friends, embarking on a "Victor's Tour" of the districts. Along the way Katniss senses that a rebellion is simmering, but the Capitol is still very much in control as President Snow prepares the 75th Annual Hunger Games (The Quarter Quell) - a competition that could change Panem forever.	jyPnQw_Lqds	2013-12-08 11:47:24.077569	2013-12-08 11:47:24.077569

1	Solution 1	We created rails application called Projects07. We have two tables inside the database, projects and solutions. (Projects name:string) (Solutions name:string explanation:string project:references) We generate Projects using Rails Scaffold command & Solutions model using Rails generate model command. We configure this relation of Projects has many solutions and solutions belong to project, inside the model folder of the rails application. 	1	2013-09-09 11:38:59.273595	2013-09-09 11:38:59.273595
2	Solution 2	We create the method viewSource inside the project model to fetch the links from Yahoo home page and output the treanding now links to our trendingNow.html page. We will add the line "projects/trendingNow" inside the routes.rb to link our page. 	1	2013-09-09 11:39:26.04628	2013-09-09 11:39:26.04628
3	Solution 3	 In the file project.rb we create the method divide. We check whether y is zero and then we open the production.long and write "About to divide by zero". Inside the divide method, we try Project.divide(1,0) and like we test in rails console, it gives out the ZeroDivisionError in ProjectsController.	1	2013-09-09 11:39:53.408178	2013-09-09 11:39:53.408178
